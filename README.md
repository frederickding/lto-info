LTO Info Tool
=============

This tool reads the internal memory of LTO/Ultrium cartridges from a tape drive ðŸ–­

More precisely, this tool can:
- Read, decode and display factory and usage information stored in the Cartridge Memory (`CM`) aka Medium Auxiliary Memory (`MAM`)
- View and modify the custom `User Medium Text Label` of a cartridge
- Display basic information about the tape drive device

## :hammer: How to build and use

You need to have a go build environment [properly set up](https://golang.org/doc/install), then just type:

```
make
```

And try the tool by typing:

```
./lto-info
```

By default, the tool will look for a tape device in `/dev/nst0`, or what is pointed to by the `TAPE` environment variable. To specify another device, use the `-d` option.
